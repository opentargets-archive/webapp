The EMBL-EBI [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database provides evidence from known drugs that can be linked to a disease and a known target. ChEMBL contains compound bioactivity data against drug targets. We display the data on drugs that have been approved for marketing by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in addition to some clinical candidates.
