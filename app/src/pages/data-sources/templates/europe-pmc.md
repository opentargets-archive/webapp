The Europe PubMed Central ([Europe PMC](http://europepmc.org/)) provides evidence of links between targets and diseases. They mine the titles, abstracts and full text research articles from both PubMed and PubMed Central, and use an entity-to-entity recognition approach to detect co-occurrences of target and disease entities.
