[PROGENy](https://saezlab.github.io/progeny/) (Pathway RespOnsive GENes) is a linear regression model that calculates pathway activity based on consensus gene signatures obtained from perturbation experiments. We use PROGENy ([Schubert et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02391-6.epdf?author_access_token=16QkzhJ3OA3qJDqBw_GvGdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NBFLUVI-ebH2AmtFlR1ykSPIho7ETJXL7VqZFC4zGtU0BaeoZncGrwx3ZW24lfVqvbSWqsQKaUXFTi_c-4pgcpX-1qerWYlkG6sha8rhrnMg%3D%3D)) for the systematic comparison of pathway activities between normal and primary samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We include in our Open Targets Platform sample-level pathway activities inferred from RNA-seq for 9,250 tumour and 741 normal TCGA samples from 14 tumour types, and compute differential pathway activities between matched normal and tumour samples. We cover the following pathways: androgen, EGFR, estrogen, hypoxia, JAK.STAT, MAPK, NFkB, PI3K, TGFb, TNFa, Trail, VEGF, WNT, and p53.
