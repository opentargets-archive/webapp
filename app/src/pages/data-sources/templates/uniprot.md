The Universal Protein Resource ([UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/)) provides protein sequence and functional information. It manually curates associations between genes and rare (Mendelian) diseases from literature and public databases. These curated variants must be in the coding region of a gene, deleterious, observed in patients, and segregating within their families.
